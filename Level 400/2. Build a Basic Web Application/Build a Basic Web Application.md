## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Tasks

This tutorial is divided into six tasks. You must complete each task in order before moving on to the next one:

1. **Create Web App**: Deploy static resources for your web application using the AWS Amplify Console.
2. **Build Serverless Function**: Build a serverless function using AWS Lambda.
3. **Create Data Table**: Persist data in an Amazon DynamoDB table.
4. **Link Serverless Function to Web App**: Deploy your serverless function with API Gateway.
5. **Add Interactivity to Web App**: Modify your web app to invoke your API.
6. **Clean Up Resources**: Clean up resources used in this tutorial.

You will be building this web application using the AWS Management Console accessible directly from your browser.

### Task 1: Create a Web App

#### Overview

AWS Amplify offers a Git-based CI/CD workflow for building, deploying, and hosting single-page web applications or static sites with backends. When connected to a Git repository, Amplify determines the build settings for both the frontend framework and any configured backend resources and automatically deploys updates with every code commit.

In this task, you will start by creating a new React application and pushing it to a GitHub repository. You will then connect the repository to AWS Amplify web hosting and deploy it to a globally available content delivery network (CDN) hosted on an `amplifyapp.com` domain.

#### Key Concepts

- **React Application**: React is a JavaScript library that enables developers to quickly build performant single-page applications.
- **Git**: Git is a version control system that allows developers to store files, maintain and update relationships between files and directories, and track versions and changes to the files.

#### Implementation

**Step 1: Create a new React application**

In a new terminal or command line window, run the following command to use Vite to create a React application:

```bash
npm create vite@latest profilesapp -- --template react
cd profilesapp
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Conclusion

You have deployed a React application in the AWS Cloud by integrating with GitHub and using AWS Amplify. With AWS Amplify, you can continuously deploy your application in the Cloud and host it on a globally available CDN.

### Task 2: Build a Serverless Function

#### Overview

Now that you have a React web app, you will use AWS Amplify and AWS Lambda to configure a serverless function. This function is invoked after a signed-up user confirms their user account. AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources, making it the fastest way to turn an idea into modern, production, serverless applications.

#### Key Concepts

- **Serverless function**: A piece of code that will be executed by a compute service, on demand.

#### Implementation

**Step 1: Setup an Amplify Function**

1. On your local machine, navigate to the `profilesapp/amplify/auth` folder and create a new folder inside the `amplify/auth` folder, naming it `post-confirmation`, and then create the files named `resource.ts` and `handler.ts` inside the folder.


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bogzj65o7wf99o9ukzrj.png)



2. Update the `amplify/auth/post-confirmation/resource.ts` file with the following code to define the `postConfirmation` function:

```typescript
import { defineFunction } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const postConfirmation = defineFunction({
  name: 'post-confirmation',
});
```


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fntkdnkcfsm2cfd5ne06.png)



3. Update the `amplify/auth/post-confirmation/handler.ts` file with the following code to define the function’s handler:

```typescript
import type { PostConfirmationTriggerHandler } from "aws-lambda";

export const handler: PostConfirmationTriggerHandler = async (event) => {
  return event;
};
```

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d5ksi1juwym25ibt3z55.png)


#### Conclusion

You have defined a Lambda function using Amplify.

### Task 3: Create a Data Table

#### Overview

In this task, you will create a data model to persist data using a GraphQL API and Amazon DynamoDB. Additionally, you will use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authorization to securely give our services the required permissions to interact with each other. You will also allow the Lambda function you created in the previous task to use the GraphQL API to write to your newly created DynamoDB table using an IAM policy.

#### Key Concepts

- **Amplify backend**: Amplify Gen 2 uses a full-stack TypeScript developer experience (DX) for defining backends. Simply author app requirements like data models, business logic, and auth rules in TypeScript. Amplify automatically configures the correct cloud resources and deploys them to per-developer cloud sandbox environments for fast, local iteration.

#### Implementation

**Step 1: Setup Amplify Data**

1. On your local machine, navigate to the `amplify/data/resource.ts` file and update it with the following code:

```typescript
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from "@aws-amplify/backend";
import { postConfirmation } from "../auth/post-confirmation/resource";

const schema = a
  .schema({
    UserProfile: a
      .model({
        email: a.string(),
        profileOwner: a.string(),
      })
      .authorization((allow) => [
        allow.ownerDefinedIn("profileOwner"),
      ]),
  })
  .authorization((allow) => [allow.resource(postConfirmation)]);

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: "apiKey",
    apiKeyAuthorizationMode: {
      expiresInDays: 30,
    },
  },
});
```

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5scoyaeu1p227is9bcz0.png)


2. Open a new terminal window, navigate to your app's root folder (`profilesapp`), and run the following command to deploy cloud resources into an isolated development space:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox
```

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iphddrjfktza2sb6y7or.png)



3. Once the cloud sandbox has been fully deployed, your terminal will display a confirmation message, and the `amplify_outputs.json` file will be generated and added to your project.


![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xt0rpvaw5xi223okiwpl.png)

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zbvyemi9fd4pmsf8a459.png)




4. Open a new terminal window, navigate to your app's root folder (`profilesapp`), and run the following command to generate the GraphQL client code to call your data backend:

```bash
npx ampx generate graphql-client-code --out <path-to-post-confirmation-handler-dir>/graphql
```

Amplify will create the folder `amplify/auth/post-confirmation/graphql`, where you will find the client code to connect to the GraphQL API.

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/buff7yvjrcz18eg6j9zn.png)

**Step 2: Modify Lambda Function to Connect to the API**

1. On your local machine, navigate to the `amplify/auth/post-confirmation/handler.ts` file and replace the code with the following:

```typescript
import type { PostConfirmationTriggerHandler } from "aws-lambda";
import { type Schema } from "../../data/resource";
import { Amplify } from "aws-amplify";
import { generateClient } from "aws-amplify/data";
import { env } from "$amplify/env/post-confirmation";
import { createUserProfile } from "./graphql/mutations";

Amplify.configure(
  {
    API: {
      GraphQL: {
        endpoint: env.AMPLIFY_DATA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT,
        region: env.AWS_REGION,
        defaultAuthMode: "iam",
      },
    },
  },
  {
    Auth: {
      credentialsProvider: {
        getCredentialsAndIdentityId: async () => ({
          credentials: {
            accessKeyId: env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
            secretAccessKey: env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
            sessionToken: env.AWS_SESSION_TOKEN,
          },
        }),
        clearCredentialsAndIdentityId: () => {
          /* noop */
        },
      },
    },
  }
);

const client = generateClient<Schema>({
  authMode: "iam",
});

export const handler: PostConfirmationTriggerHandler = async (event) => {
  await client.graphql({
    query: createUserProfile,
    variables: {
      input: {
        email: event.request.userAttributes.email,
        profileOwner: `${event.request.userAttributes.sub}::${event.userName}`,
      },
    },
  });

  return event;
};
```

#### Conclusion

You have created a data table and configured a GraphQL API to persist data in an Amazon DynamoDB database. Then, you updated the Lambda function to use the API.

### Task 4: Link a Serverless Function to a Web App

#### Overview

In this task, you will update the Amplify Auth resources to use the Lambda function created in the previous module as an Amazon Cognito post-confirmation invocation. When the user completes the sign-up, the function will use the GraphQL API and capture the user’s email into the DynamoDB table.

#### Key Concepts

- **Lambda invocation**: The type of event that will make a Lambda (serverless) function run. This can be another AWS service or an external input.

#### Implementation

**Step 1: Setup Amplify Auth**

1. On your local machine, navigate to the `amplify/auth/resource.ts` file and update it with the following code:

```typescript
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { postConfirmation } from './post-confirmation/resource';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
  },
  triggers: {
    postConfirmation
  }
});
```

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wvhc4cmh7yk2rygooc2l.png)


2. The sandbox will automatically get updated and redeployed once the file is updated. If the sandbox is not running, you can run the following command in a new terminal window:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox
```

3. Once the cloud sandbox has been fully deployed, your terminal will display a confirmation message, and the `amplify_outputs.json` file will be generated/updated and added to your `profilesapp` project.

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lk9y6p9dqssbatfahfqc.png)



#### Conclusion

You used Amplify to configure authentication and set up the Lambda function to be invoked when the user signs in to the app.

### Task 5: Add Interactivity to Your Web App

#### Overview

In this task, you will create a frontend for your app and connect it to the cloud backend you have already built. You will update the website to use the Amplify UI component library to scaffold out an entire user authentication flow, allowing users to sign up, sign in, reset their password, and invoke the GraphQL API.

#### Key Concepts

- **Amplify libraries**: The Amplify libraries allow you to interact with AWS services from a web or mobile application.

#### Implementation

**Step 1: Install the Amplify libraries**

In a new terminal window, in your project's root folder (`profilesapp`), run the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1b5f5ilu9vlb1xiabv7c.png)

**Step 2: Style the app UI**

On your local machine, navigate to the `profilesapp/src/index.css` file and update it with the following code:

```css
:root {
  font-family: Inter, system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.5;
  font-weight: 400;
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87);
  font-synthesis: none;
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  max-width: 1280px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 2rem;
}

.card {
  padding: 2em;
}

.read-the-docs {
  color: #888;
}

.box:nth-child(3n + 1) {
  grid-column: 1;
}
.box:nth-child(3n + 2) {
  grid-column: 2;
}
.box:nth-child(3n + 3) {
  grid-column: 3;
}
```

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9kow792o60t4igvm2m5e.png)


**Step 3: Implement the UI**

On your local machine, navigate to the `profilesapp/src/main.jsx` file and update it with the following code:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.jsx";
import "./index.css";
import { Authenticator } from "@aws-amplify/ui-react";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>

## Congratulations!

You have successfully created a React web app and used AWS Amplify to configure authentication and data resources. Additionally, you created a function to update the data model with user details upon sign-up. Then, you built a frontend to display the captured data. Finally, you used AWS Amplify to host the app!

Feel free to explore further and expand on this project as needed. The sky's the limit with AWS Amplify!

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

- **Challenge 1**: Configuring User Authentication
AWS Amplify simplifies authentication setup, but customization may require configuration adjustments in the Amplify Console.

- **Challenge 2**: Data Consistency
DynamoDB may not immediately reflect changes, especially with concurrent requests. Using AppSync’s real-time updates ensures data synchronization across all instances.

- **Challenge 3**: Lambda Function Limits
AWS imposes limits on Lambda’s execution time and memory. Optimize the function code and adjust settings in the Amplify Console if needed.

## Conclusion

In this project, I learned how to build and deploy a simple web application with user authentication and data storage on AWS using Amplify. The setup demonstrates a full-stack serverless application, ideal for rapid development and easy scaling. AWS Amplify offers an efficient way to manage web applications and their backend services, perfect for various use cases, from prototyping to production.
