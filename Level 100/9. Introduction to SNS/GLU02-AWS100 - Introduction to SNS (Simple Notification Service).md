## Objectives

### You need to complete the following:

- Create an SNS topic
- Subscribe to that SNS topic with an email address of yours
- Make sure to accept the subscription in the email you receive
- Send a test message through the SNS topic
- Make sure you received the message to your email address

### You need to answer the following:

### ***What is Simple Notification Service (SNS)?***

**Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)** is a fully managed messaging service provided by AWS that enables you to send messages to multiple subscribers through a "publish/subscribe" model. SNS decouples the messaging from your infrastructure, allowing you to send notifications to a large number of distributed systems, users, or other applications. It can push notifications to various endpoints such as mobile devices (via SMS or push notifications), email, HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, or AWS services like SQS or Lambda.

### ***How do Pub/Sub notifications work?***

The **Pub/Sub** (Publish/Subscribe) model in SNS operates as follows:

1. **Topic Creation:** A topic is created by the publisher (the service or user who wants to send messages).
2. **Subscription:** Subscribers (other AWS services, applications, or endpoints) subscribe to the topic to receive notifications.
3. **Publishing:** The publisher sends a message to the topic.
4. **Message Delivery:** SNS automatically sends the message to all subscribers of the topic through their respective endpoints. Delivery is fan-out, meaning the same message is pushed to all subscribers.

In this model, the publisher doesn't need to know about the details of the subscribers, and the subscribers donâ€™t need to interact directly with the publisher.

### ***What are the different endpoints that SNS can send notifications to?***

SNS can send notifications to a variety of endpoints, including:

1. **Amazon SQS:** Sends notifications to Amazon Simple Queue Service queues.
2. **AWS Lambda:** Triggers AWS Lambda functions in response to messages.
3. **HTTP/HTTPS:** Delivers messages to web endpoints over HTTP or HTTPS.
4. **Email/Email-JSON:** Sends notifications via email, either in text format or JSON format.
5. **SMS:** Sends text messages to mobile devices via SMS.
6. **Mobile Push Notifications:** Sends push notifications to mobile devices (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) through services like Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

### ***What happens if a message or notification in SNS cannot be delivered?***

If a message or notification cannot be delivered, SNS handles it based on the type of endpoint:

- For **SQS, Lambda, or HTTP/HTTPS** endpoints, SNS will attempt to deliver the message a few times (depending on the retry policy) before marking it as failed.
- For **SMS**, if delivery fails, no further retries are made, but you can track delivery status via CloudWatch logs.
- **Dead-letter queues (DLQ)** can be configured for SQS and Lambda endpoints to capture messages that fail after multiple delivery attempts.
- SNS also supports **delivery status logging** using Amazon CloudWatch for debugging and monitoring failures.

### ***What's the difference between Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Simple Queue Service (SQS)?***

- **SNS** uses a push-based model, where messages are delivered immediately to subscribers (e.g., HTTP endpoints, Lambda functions, etc.) as soon as they are published to a topic.
- **SQS** uses a pull-based model, where messages are stored in queues, and consumers must poll (pull) the queue to receive them.

**Key differences:**

1. **Delivery Model:**
    - **SNS:** Push-based (messages are pushed to subscribers).
    - **SQS:** Pull-based (messages are stored in queues and must be pulled by consumers).
2. **Use Case:**

    - **SNS:** Suitable for real-time notifications where the message needs to be delivered to multiple subscribers (fan-out messaging).
    - **SQS:** Best for decoupling services or processing tasks asynchronously, where messages are processed by one or more workers.

3. **Message Retention:**

    - **SNS:** Does not store messages after they are delivered.
    - **SQS:** Messages can be stored for up to 14 days in a queue.

4. **Subscriber Count:**

    - **SNS:** Supports multiple subscribers (many-to-many relationship).
    - **SQS:** Supports one-to-one communication between sender and receiver. However, SQS can be combined with SNS to achieve fan-out.

By combining SNS and SQS, we can achieve powerful architectures, where SNS pushes messages to SQS queues, and those queues are polled by consumers for processing.
